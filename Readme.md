# Customized Productivity app
My goal with this app is to have all productivity related tools into one place. Specifically
* Todo-list
* Habit tracker
* Weekly schedule 
* Project manager (Something similar to [Trello](https://trello.com/))
* [Impossible List](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/)
* List of upcoming events using Google Calender API

All of this I aim to implement using QT
